<h2>BE VERY CAREFUL WITH SCAMS!</h2>
<p>
    Don't mint your tubby on any website other than https://tubbycats.xyz/ and verify everything against the information on the #links channel in tubby discord.<br />
    If you get scammed there's nothing we can do, so please be very careful.<br />
    This is a page for advanced users that want to mint directly through etherscan.<br />
    Remember that you can only claim 1 tubby per account. If you have already claimed trying to claim again will result in a failed tx.<br />
